# Tools to help run Tomcat under launchd

The .plist file needs to be edited with the correct path to tomcat in numerous places. It is possible that the WorkingDirectory setting means that not all paths need to be absolute, but I didnâ€™t test it. It should also be renamed; I anonymized it since I made it public.

The shell script needs to go in the tomcat "bin" directory. It is necessary to wrap tomcat, since tomcat's default startup script forks itself into the background and launchd would continuously try to restart it.


## Installation

1. Copy the .plist file to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and modify the paths and labels as needed.
2. Copy launchd\_wrapper.sh to your Tomcat "bin" folder and make sure it is executable (`chmod +x launchd_wrapper.sh`).
3. `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/mysite.tomcat.plist`

To stop/disable the service:

`launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/mysite.tomcat.plist`
